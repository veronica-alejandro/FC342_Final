# FC342_Final
Final project for FC 342 (French through Coding) at UT Austin.
This project uses data from archived Le Monde journals since 1960 and French songs since 1985 to analyze how common anglicisms are in each medium and if they have become more common. My initial hypothesis is that 1) anglicisms will be more common in French songs, and 2) in both mediums, anglicisms will have increased in use throughout the years.
